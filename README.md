idealgoldv2 is an open source crypto-currency focused on fast private transactions with low transaction fees & low confirmations.  It is currently under development and plans are to pull in Bitcoin's improvements for a PIVX clone. I am targeting a mid-December 2018 re-release of the coin.

If the date changes I will notify everyone. Please note that everyone that had a balance during the first release will get an airdrop on re-release plus some extra to cover the trouble and lost time during the first try.

It will be Proof of Stake after a 100,000 block Proof of Work period with masternodes. After 100,000 staked wallets will help support the network.
